# II Bioinformatics

Algorithms for the Part II [Bioinformatics](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1920/Bioinfo/) course at Cambridge University.

Taken from the supplementary textbook and [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/).


*Disclaimer.* Algorithms are not necessarily optimised for time and space, but are written so that I can remember and understand how they work by just looking at them.
